Blizzard file:
1. classification, 'blizzard' to 'Blizzard' as output
2. classification, 'wind_speed', if statment will never return condition 2, switch condition 1 & 2
3. get_advice, 'Severe blizzard' required classification 'Severe Blizzard'

Hurricane file:
4. classification, Condition 1, '<=' needs to be '>='
5. classification, End return, requirement is 'Tropical Storm' for anything else

Tornado:
6. classification, Condition 1, '<=' needs to be '<'. Boundary is 40 AND below = 'Unclassified'
7. get_advice, Condition 1, 'Unclassified' incorrect in list. Remove.
8. Class not returning name & wind_speed values within __init__.
9. get_advice, Condition 2, incorrectly formatted list (delimiters)

StormCentre:
10. add to list, <=20 to <20
11. class 'instance' missing in first def condition 3
12. first if statement, Condition 3, missing Hurricance Class instance (& import of class)
13. remove_storm, true & false return swap
14. update_storm, wind_speed dictionary missing "_"



Don't know if actual error:
    - Already_exists returns true into 'not' in condition 2 of first if. instead of return false, found in list, into if saving a true into 'not', which is alittle confusing. But not actually wrong.
    - Syntax error on view_storm, '-> Storm or None' should be '-> Storm | None'
